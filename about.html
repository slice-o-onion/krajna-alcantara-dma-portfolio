				<strong>
					I am Krajna Alcantara (pronounced "cray-ee-na"), a Digital Media Artist currently attending San Jose State University.
					 I'm a Filipino immigrant born in a rural city Batangas, Philippines and immigrated with my family in Daly City.
					 I come from a photography background in highschool and
					 took some Art History and Photography classes at Skyline community college at San Bruno.
						<br></br>
					I firmly believe in Bob Ross's quote: "There are no mistakes, only happy accidents."
					I love experimenting with my work, which oftentimes leads me to unconventional angles in an artpiece and giving them an edge, like my artworks made from
					my <a href="codework.html"> brush code pieces</a>, <a href="3dworks.html"> 3D artworks</a>,
					and my <em>Liquify</em>-based <a href="digitalworks.html"> Digital Art</a>.
					<br></br>
					I have been a self-taught artist since I was young, starting out with pen and paper, then Photoshop and Paint Tool Sai, and eventually since last year, Procreate.
					Since then, I have been exploring different forms of digital art such as pixel art, video editing and animation.
					 Additionally, I am experimenting and finding my own art style in abstract terms.
					 In the future, I want to create my own video game to share around the world and learn other forms of digital art.

						<br></br>
						 I think that DMA is a great major to be able to explore everything digital,with a lot of variety and yet also offering intertwined focuses.
						Most of my work is 2D, but I want to develop my 3D skills and develop 3D games, 3D art, and maybe even some
						3D animations. My goal is to further increase my knowledge in other forms of art so that I have more assets added onto my knowledge to further experiment and
						hopefully work in a company as a lead artist or designer, or even have my work displayed in museums!
						<br></br>
						 In addition,
						 I'm interested in learning about 3D printing and design, as well as learning more about
							AR and VR to hopefully be able to create my own world and maybe even be able to implement my
							<a href="3dworks.html">"Creatures of the Subconscious"</a> into it. DMA has allowed me to be myself and create
							 cool and entertaining art that inspires people to be more experimental.
							 Overall, DMA is a fun and interesting major with so many interesting classes I want to learn about.
