	<h1> <em>Dealing With Blindness (Art 75)</em> </h1>
	<strong>
I made this video for my Art 75 final (Spring 2022).Though unexpected, during finals season around the time of my birthday I suddenly had an itch on my eyes that grew to be temporary blindness.I was really frustrated by the timing of it because it was literally <em>finals week</em>, and a few days later I was going to turn 21 with plans to hang out with my friends I hadn't seen in a while.It was such bad timing as I was nearing my first year of being alone without any support from my parents(who had kicked me out),merely depending on my own money working full-time as well as taking a full load of classes per semester. Pretty much a perfect storm situation over here.
					<br></br>
Despite all this, I made use of my stressful situation and based my video of what I was currently feeling. Dejected and feeling lost in a city I barely knew, I was inspired by these emotions and made "Dealing with Blindness"to document my frustrations and hopefully as time goes on, I can look back on this video and be thankful I survived that situation.
					 <br><em>(note: audio starting at 02:30 was an excerpt of an audio I sent to my boyfriend after a long day).</em>
					 <br>
					 After finals week, I got my eyes checked and turns out I lost my perfect vision and am now 20/25, with an array of newfound allergies. The doctor also said it was the result of stress.OOF. Hurray, adulthood.
